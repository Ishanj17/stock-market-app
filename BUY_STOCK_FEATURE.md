# Buy Stock Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive buy stock functionality that allows authenticated users to purchase stocks directly from the stock details page with a confirmation modal and automatic navigation to the investments page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Buy Stock Button in Stock Details
- **Location**: Right side of stock header, next to risk level
- **Visibility**: Only shown when user is authenticated
- **Icon**: Shopping cart icon (FaShoppingCart)
- **Styling**: Same theme colors (teal to green gradient)
- **Position**: Left of the user avatar (when on stock details page)

### 2. Buy Stock Modal
- **Design**: Similar to login modal with split layout
- **Left Panel**: Green background with stock investment messaging
- **Right Panel**: Purchase confirmation form
- **Features**:
  - Stock details display
  - Quantity selector with +/- buttons
  - Real-time total amount calculation
  - Purchase confirmation button
  - Loading state during purchase

### 3. Purchase Flow
1. User clicks "Buy Stock" button
2. Modal opens with stock details and quantity selector
3. User selects quantity (minimum 1)
4. Total amount updates in real-time
5. User confirms purchase
6. Mock API call processes the purchase
7. Modal closes and user is redirected to investments page
8. Investments page refreshes with updated portfolio data

### 4. Backend Integration
- **Mock API Endpoint**: `/api/investments/buy-stock`
- **Request**: POST with stock details and quantity
- **Response**: Success confirmation with transaction details
- **Authentication**: Uses JWT token from localStorage

### 5. Investments Page Refresh
