# Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the authentication implementation that includes:
1. Login/Signup modal with email verification
2. Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful authentication
3. User avatar in header showing first name initial
4. User dropdown menu with logout functionality

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Context
- Created `AuthContext` to manage global user state
- Handles login, logout, and user data persistence
- Stores authentication token and user data in localStorage

### 2. Login/Signup Flow
- Email verification step to determine if user exists
- Password login for existing users
- Signup flow for new users
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful authentication

### 3. Header Updates
- Shows user's first name initial in a circular avatar when authenticated
- Replaces login/signup button with user avatar
- Dropdown menu with user info and logout option
- Click outside to close dropdown menu

### 4. Backend Updates
- Updated login response to include `first_name`
- Updated signup response to include `first_name`
- JWT token generation for authentication

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Test Authentication Flow
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Login/Sign up" button in the header
3. Enter an email address
4. If the email doesn't exist, you'll be prompted to create an account
5. If the email exists, you'll be prompted to enter your password
6. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the dashboard
7. The header will now show your first name initial instead of the login button
8. Click on the avatar to see the dropdown menu with logout option

### 4. Test Logout
1. Click on your avatar in the header
2. Click "Sign Out" in the dropdown menu
3. You'll be logged out and redirected to the dashboard
4. The header will show the login/signup button again

## File Structure

### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js` - Authentication context
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Wrapped with AuthProvider
- `frontend/src/components/auth/LoginModal.jsx` - Updated with authentication logic
- `frontend/src/components/common/Header.jsx` - Updated with user avatar and menu

### Backend Changes
- `backend/controllers/userController.js` - Updated login and signup responses

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters email → Backend checks if user exists
2. If user exists → Show password field
3. If user doesn't exist → Show signup form
4. On successful login/signup → Store token and user data → Redirect to dashboard

### User Data Structure
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  firstName: "John"
}
```

### Token Storage
- JWT token stored in localStorage as 'authToken'
- User data stored in localStorage as 'userData'
- Token expires after 1 hour

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- User data is validated on both frontend and backend
